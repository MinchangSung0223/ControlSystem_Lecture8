\begin{itemize}
	\item (8.3.6) Applicability Limits of the Discrete Equivalent Design Method
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The system can often be \emph{unstable} for rates slower than approximately $5\omega_{bd}$, and 
		\item the damping would be \emph{degraded} significantly for rates slower than about $10\omega_{bd}$ 
		\item At sample rates $\geq 20 \omega_{bd}$, design by discrete equivalent yields \emph{reasonable} results, and 
		\item at sample rates of 25 times the bandwidth or higher, discrete equivalents can be used \emph{with confidence}. 
		\item ZOH brings $T/2$ delay in the control system. A method to account for the $T/2$ delay is to include an approximation of the delay into the original plant model: 
		\begin{align*}
			G_{ZOH} (s) = \frac{2/T}{s+ 2/T}		
		\end{align*}
	\end{enumerate}
